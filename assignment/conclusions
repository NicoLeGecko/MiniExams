Many thanks for giving me this interesting task, and for checking out my result!
It proved to be quite challenging. I surely learned a lot :)

Here's the timeline of my effort: 
4h - learning Vue on Codecademy
---
1h - initial drawing and backlog
1h - setting up the dev environment
1h - creating a static card 
2h - refactoring card
1h - knowledge of selected answer alternatives
2h - adding/removing answer alternatives
2h - adding/removing question cards
---

The result is a little underwhelming to my taste.
I didn't manage to implement the preview or test-taking.
Even most of my "rough first backlog" was not implemented.
Many other ideas I had along the way, I had to let go to get something done in time. (UX, refactoring, data structures...)

On the existing parts, some improvements could be:
- The UI and UX. Starting with centering and sizing elements correctly.
- More separation of concerns. My model is hardcoded in the views, and there are no clear interfaces.
- More homogenous coding patterns. Proper models and encapsulation.
- Injecting dependecies, making use of design patterns, to decouple components.
- Fixing the bug (issue #5).

Thanks again!
