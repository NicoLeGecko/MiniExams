# Mini Exam App

## Problem

Our teachers need to be able to create "Mini-exams", which only consist of "Multiple Response" questions.

Your task is to implement a rudimentary interface that a teacher could use to create these exams.

### Criteria

We evaluate your solution based on the following criteria:

- UX/UI experience
- Project architecture & data structures
- Code complexity & efficiency
- Readability
- Automated testing (Bonus)

### Question Structure

Multiple Response Questions have the following properties:

- Question formulation (body)
- Answer alternatives
- More than one answer alternative can be chosen

## Appetite (Time limit)

We are assuming you spend around **8-10 hours** on the project, but you have **1 week** to send in the solution.

## Allowed Materials

- You can choose between using Plain Javascript or the VueJS framework
- You may use third-party dependencies that aid the developer experience, such as CSS pre-processors
  - We discourage the use of third-party dependencies that aid the solution of the problem, such as algorithmic utilities or ready-made data structures.

## Desired Solution

We want to keep the criteria as open as possible, to prevent leading / anchoring. But we see the following criterias as the bare minimum.

### Creating "Multiple Response Questions"

The user must be able to create questions and add alternatives

### Previewing and testing the exam

The user must be able to preview their created exam as well as test out

#### Bonus: View exam results

The teacher should be able to get some feedback / results when checking correct / incorrect answers

## No-gos

These things do not need to be implemented:

- Listing exams
- Saving exams

# Submitting your solution

Create a [GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) with your code and send us a link / invitation to the project. We would appreciate if you create an initial ("empty") commit before you start coding so that we can more easily follow the timeline of your solution.
