# MiniExams
A tool for teachers to create mini-exams and test them, in VueJS.

## Where to start
Have a look at the /assignment folder, where I documented:
1. the instructions (readme.md),
2. my first idea of a backlog, with a rough sketch,
3. my conclusions, after finishing.

The code is inside /mini-exams.
I created the environment using `npm init vue@latest`
